      <h2>About Rabbits</h2>
      <p>
       Frequently the terms rabbit and hare are used interchangeably, a practice that can cause confusion. Jackrabbits, for instance, are actually hares, whereas the rockhares and the hispid hare are rabbits. Rabbits differ from hares in size, life history, and preferred habitat. 
      <h2>Habitat</h2>
      <p>
        Rabbits are found in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, meadows, forests, and deserts. They prefer areas with plenty of vegetation for food and bushes or burrows for shelter. Rabbits are highly adaptable and can also thrive in farmlands and urban parks, provided there is sufficient cover and food..
