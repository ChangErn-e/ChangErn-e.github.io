      <h2>About Leopard</h2>
      <p>
        The leopard varies greatly in size and markings.
         The average size is 50 to 90 kg (110 to 200 pounds) in weight, 
         210 cm (84 inches), excluding the 90-cm tail, in length, and 60 to 70 cm in 
         shoulder height. The leopard can, however, grow much larger. The ground colour 
         is typically yellowish above and white below.
       
      <h2>Habitat</h2>
      <p>
        Leopards (Panthera pardus) are highly adaptable and thrive in diverse habitats,
         including rainforests, savannas, grasslands, temperate forests, mountains,
          and deserts across Africa and Asia. They are also found near urban areas, particularly in India. Their adaptability is enhanced by their solitary and nocturnal behavior, excellent climbing skills, and ability to thrive in both dense forests and open plains. 
        This versatility makes leopards one of the most widespread big cats.
