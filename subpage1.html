      <h2>About Snakes</h2>
      <p>
        Snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica and have adapted to a variety of habitats, 
        including forests, deserts, wetlands, and grasslands. Most snakes are non-venomous, 
        relying on constriction or ambush to catch their prey.

      <p>
        Snakes inhabit diverse regions, from tropical rainforests to arid deserts. Some species are aquatic,
