      <h2>About Tiger</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout the tiger's range, it inhabits mainly forests, from coniferous and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the 
        Russian Far East and Northeast China to tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests on the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.

      <h2>Habitat</h2>
      <p>
        Tigers are highly adaptable and inhabit a wide range of environments, including tropical rainforests, mangrove swamps, grasslands, and temperate forests.
         They prefer habitats with dense vegetation for camouflage, access to freshwater, and abundant prey like deer and wild boar.
         From the snowy forests of Siberia to the mangroves of the Sundarbans, tigers thrive in areas that provide cover, food, and large territories to roam.
