      <h2>About Panda</h2>
      <p>
        Large males may attain 1.8 metres (6 feet) in length and weigh more than 100 kg (220 pounds); females are usually smaller. Round black ears and black eye patches stand out against a white face and neck. Black limbs, tail, legs, and shoulders contrast with the white torso. The rear paws point inward, which gives pandas a waddling gait.
       
      <h2>Habitat</h2>
      <p>
        Pandas live in the mountainous regions of central China, mainly in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces. They thrive in dense bamboo forests at elevations of 5,000 to 10,000 feet, where bamboo makes up 99% of their diet. These forests provide the cool, moist climate pandas prefer and plenty of cover for shelter.
